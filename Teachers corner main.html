  This website is another great resource for professional educators who are looking to expand their knowledge of implementing ESOL strategies into their classroom. Colorin Colorado provides strategies on literacy instruction for ELLs, and books for elementary and young adult language learners. This is a great place to try to find a reading that appeals to your students funds of knowledge.

Moll (1992) states, “by capitalizing on household and other community resources, we can organize classroom instruction that far exceeds in quality the rote-like instruction these children commonly encounter in schools” (p. 132). In other words, Moll (1992) is saying that in order for to deliver a meaningful education to their students, teachers need to build a deeper understanding of their student population that goes beyond the classroom and into the community. Colorin Colorado is a resource that can help teachers find available readings that appeal to your ELL population. This will both increase learning and interest in your class.
